# faster-rcnn-tf-py3
if you need faster-rcnn-tf-py3, you can visit https://github.com/smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF for help. I wrote this according to  smallcorgi.

I think my repo has the following cons:

1. Almost every .py file will have a test to see.

2. The version is tensorflow python3.5, it solve some problems from py2 to py3.

3. The usage can follow the smallcorgi's readme.

4. There are some Chinese annotations in some files, if you have some problem about the repo, you can contact with me xh@mail.ustc.edu.cn, I will reply you as soon as possible.
